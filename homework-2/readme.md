## Assignment 2: Git Readme

### Blog Topic Summary

My blog is about the Mothman, because I love the mothman and he's my favorite cryptid.

### Key Takeaways

This assignment was a good refresher on basic webpage styling using <em>CSS<em>. I tried to do as much from memory as possible but had to peek at previous work once or twice, mainly for help on centering my content on my page. Overall a fun exercise!
