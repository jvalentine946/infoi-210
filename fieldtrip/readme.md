## Field Trip Project

### Project Summary

The Eiteljorg museum is currently hosting an exhibit called "Radical Stitch", showcasing beadwork by Native/Indigenous artists from across the United States. I chose this topic because beadwork as an art form is highly technical, and is often used to tell stories. By creating a website highlighting beadwork from different Indigenous artists, visitors to the site will be able to learn more about these communities, their history, and their struggles and triumphs, all of which are often pushed to the side.

### Core Webpages

Home Page - An introductory page that explains the basics of the exhibit (how long it will be running, where to see it, what times the exhibit is open, etc.)

Artist Pages - Multiple pages highlighting the individuals artists whose works are displayed in the exhibit, with artist bios and a few sample photos of their work.

Interactive Artwork Page - An interactive widget where visitors to the site are able to create their own beadwork. This could be done through a video showing the beading process that requires the viewer to click along at different points to finish the beadwork, or something that allows visitors to choose different beads to put on a template image.

### Design Choices

The Eiteljorg museum has a very clean and simple layout on their own website, so I would use that as a reference. Since the beadwork itself is very colorful, I would not want to webpage design to detract from that. I would use a simple white base with black lettering for most of the site, with a muted blue for more important headings such as Artist names.
