# Assignment 1: Git Readme

## Websites vs Web Applications

Websites are a _static_ display of information. Examples of a website include blogs, archive websites, and other static deisplays of information (which may be in the form of text, images, audio, etc.). Web applications are _interactive_ and/or _collaborative_ in nature, and function as software. The key difference is in their **dynamicism**, though they are not mutually exclusive, and many websites host web applications on them.

## VS Code & Extensions

Visual studio code is an integrated development environment that we will be using for coding in class. VS Code has several extensions that improve the look and function of your code as you work. Some extensions such as Prettier serve a practical role in coding, in this case _increasing readability_. While other extensions, like VS Code Pets, are just _cute_.

## Version Control, Git, & GitHub

Github and Git have similar names, but different functions. Git is used for version control, as it keeps track of changes you make in your code. Github acts as a store spot for your files/code.

## Markdown & Documentation

Markdown is a markup language used to format plain text for HTML. Markdown is
easily converted to HTML, and uses a variety of symbols for simple text formatting. Ex: _italics_, **bold**, and headings, which are found throughout this read.me. Docomentation is important within code to explain different sections of code, i.e. how a piece of code works, what it does, etc. Dcoumentation is important both for those creating the code when looking back at their work, and for providing guides for future individuals who may evaluate the code.
